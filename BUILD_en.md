# 1 How to Build Environment from Scratch

### Introduction to Dependencies

- Python

  The minimum supported versions vary for different packages. It's recommended to use version 3.8 or higher. Using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to build the environment can save a lot of time.

- CUDA

  [Official Website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) - Recommended versions are [10.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive), and as a secondary option, [11.7.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-7-0-download-archive). Compatibility with other versions is unknown.

- cuDNN (For CUDA 11.x, 10.2)

  [Version 8.7 Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download) - Match the version with CUDA. For installation instructions, refer to the [cuDNN Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html).

- TensorRT (For CUDA 11.x, 10.2) (Optional)

  [Version 8.x Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-8x-download) - Match the version with CUDA. Recommend using `8.4.2.4 (TensorRT 8.4 GA Update 1)`. For installation instructions, refer to the [TensorRT Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/install-guide/index.html).

- For CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT (Optional), configure the system's Path based on their respective official documentation.

- Reopen PowerShell and enter the following commands to verify successful configuration:

    ```bash
    PS C:\> python -V
    Python 3.8.10
    PS C:\> pip -V
    pip 22.3.1 from <python-install-path>\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)
    PS C:\> nvcc -V
    nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver

    ```

### Download Software
Download the latest version of the software to your local computer from the [release page](https://github.com/Yutong-gannis/ETSAuto/releases).

### Install Dependency Packages

Run the following commands in the project root directory.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Weight Files
Download the [ONNX weight file](https://github.com/Yutong-gannis/ETSAuto/releases/download/v2.0/ep049.onnx) and place it in the `<PROJECT_PATH>/weights` folder (create manually).

### Tested Environments

Successfully ran on Windows 11 + Python 3.8 under the following conditions:

- CUDA 10.2 + cuDNN 8.7.0 + TensorRT 8.4.2.4
- CUDA 11.2 + cuDNN 8.7.0 + TensorRT 8.4.2.4
- CUDA 11.7 + cuDNN 8.7.0 + TensorRT 8.4.2.4
- CUDA 11.7 + cuDNN 8.7.0 + TensorRT 8.4.3.1
- CUDA 10.2 + cuDNN 8.7.0

# 2 Game Settings
### Install Virtual Joystick

Download vJoy from the [project link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/) and install by double-clicking.

### Install Plugins
In the [thirdparty/ets2-sdk-plugin](https://github.com/Yutong-gannis/ETSAuto/tree/v2.x/thirdparty/ets2-sdk-plugin) directory, choose the WIN32 or WIN64 folder based on your device. Copy the **ets2-telemetry.dll** file from the folder to the `bin/win_x86/plugins` directory in the root installation folder of Euro Truck Simulator 2. If the `plugins` folder doesn't exist, create it manually. Once you start the game, if you see a warning, it indicates that the installation is complete.

### Install Mods

Download mods from the Steam Workshop:

- Google Maps Navigation Night Version
- SISL's Route Adviser

### In-Game Settings

- Options - Graphics: Disable full-screen mode, set the resolution to 1360x768.
- Options - Controls: Choose `Keyboard + vJoy Device`.
- Options - Keys and Buttons: Unassign the numeric keypad **num 0~9**, **Up**, **Down**, **Left**, **Right** keys; these keys are used in the program.
- Move the game window to the upper-left corner of the screen for screen capture (note: fine-tune left and right by a few pixels to ensure the vehicle is centered
